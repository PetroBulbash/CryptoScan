## Overview
The CryptoScan program is designed to search for cryptocurrency keys and addresses on a PC and removable storage devices. 
It can be useful for investigators, computer security specialists, individuals who have lost (forgotten) files with data about their crypto wallets.

## Interface
The program has a fully graphical interface and runs via an exe file. It does not require installation and can be used by investigators who have no knowledge of programming.

## Support
Programm has tested for Windows only.

## Using
In order to use the program, download and unpack the [release](https://github.com/PetroBulbash/CryptoScan/releases/), run the file cryptoscan.exe . A simple instruction for working with the program opens when you click the "help" button.

## For developers
The program is developed in Python 3.9. It has not been tested on other versions of Python.<br>
To design the interface, a browser is used, into which a local web file is loaded (HTML+CSS+JS).

## Thanks
The motivation for the development was script [BTCScan](https://gist.github.com/chriswcohen/7e28c95ba7354a986c34) from Chris Cohen to search for BTC-addresses (some code is borrowed from this script).<br>
Some code is also taken from the [cryptocurrency-address-detector](https://gist.github.com/chriswcohen/7e28c95ba7354a986c34) (autor Nikolaos Kamarinakis).<br>
The [CoinAddrValidator](https://pypi.org/project/coinaddrvalidator/) from Mohammad Aghamir plays a big role.
